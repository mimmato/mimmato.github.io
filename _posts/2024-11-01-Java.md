## JAVA

In this post, I will explore Java, theoretical concepts, my local setup and will also share some thoughts on programming with Java as a complete beginner. I am starting a QA Automation course at a local academy which will also cover Java programming, however, the information I will share here will mostly be based on my personal research. 

One the most recommended paths to take when starting off as a beginner in programming and Java is the Mooc.fi course on learning Java (https://java-programming.mooc.fi/). I will  try to update this blog post as I advance through the course.
