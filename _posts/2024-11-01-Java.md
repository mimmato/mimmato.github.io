In this post, I will explore Java, theoretical concepts, my local setup and will also share some thoughts on programming with Java as a complete beginner. I am starting a QA Automation course at a local academy which will also cover Java programming, however, the information I will share here will mostly be based on my personal research. 

One the most recommended paths to take when starting off as a beginner in programming and Java is the Mooc.fi course on learning Java (https://java-programming.mooc.fi/). I will  try to update this blog post as I advance through the course. 

## Why Java?

This section will cover information about why Java is the preferred language in QA...



## Printing:

Basic syntax

`System.out.println("Hello world!");`

Common shortcuts used in IDEs like IntelliJ and NetBeans:

`sout` + `TAB`

## Reading input:

#### Scanner tool:

`import java.util.Scanner;`

##### Scanner tool method:

`scanner.nextLine()`

## Concatenation:

## Strings:

String literal
String variable

## Reading Strings:

## Variable types in Java:

String
double
int
boolean



command.valueOf

converting strings 


 if the program handles both the sum of the numbers and their total count as integers, one (or both) of the variables should be casted to a floating-point number by multiplying it by 1.0 before the division.
