In this post, I will explore Java, theoretical concepts, my local setup and will also share some thoughts on programming with Java as a complete beginner. I am starting a QA Automation course at a local academy which will also cover Java programming, however, the information I will share here will mostly be based on my personal research. 

One the most recommended paths to take when starting off as a beginner in programming and Java is the Mooc.fi course on learning Java (https://java-programming.mooc.fi/). I will  try to update this blog post as I advance through the course. 

## Why Java?

This section will cover information about why Java is the preferred language in QA...



## Printing:

Basic syntax

`System.out.println("Hello world!");`

Common shortcuts used in IDEs like IntelliJ and NetBeans:

`sout` + `TAB`

## Reading input:

#### Scanner tool:

`import java.util.Scanner;`

##### Scanner tool method:

`scanner.nextLine()`

## Concatenation:

## Strings:

String literal
String variable

## Reading Strings:

## Variable types in Java:

String
double
int
boolean



command.valueOf

Integer.valueOf
Boolean.valueOf
Double.valueOf

converting strings 


 if the program handles both the sum of the numbers and their total count as integers, one (or both) of the variables should be casted to a floating-point number by multiplying it by 1.0 before the division.


## Conditional statements and conditional operation


Strings equals

The equals command is written after a string by attaching it to the string to be compared with a dot. The command is given a parameter, which is the string that the variable will be compared against. If the string variable is being directly compared with a string, then the string can be placed inside the parentheses of the equals-command within quotation marks. Otherwise, the name of the string variable that holds the string to be compared is placed inside the parentheses.


    > greater than
    >= greater than or equal to
    < less than
    <= less than or equal to
    == equal to
    != not equal to



Logical Operators




## Loops



## Primitive types (variables)
