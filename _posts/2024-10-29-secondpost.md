# Intro:

I realize that my setup might be a bit unncessarily complicated, so the installation of pages and the local configuration of my environment was particularly troublesome. 

I am working on a Windows PC at the moment and have Windows Subdirectoy Linux (WSL2) enabled. I have to add this was not my first attempt to work with GitHub Pages and the main issue had to with the number of component versions I had installed in different ways during the past.
